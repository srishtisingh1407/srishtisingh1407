As a dedicated member and an enthusiastic supporter of Codechef, I am delighted to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the club's outstanding contributions and achievements.
The past Six months in this club were full of new events, new connections, and definitely a lot of new skill learning.

I would like to highlight some activities that helped me grow personally.
Starting with the recruitment round task, I used Js for the first time.

As a beginner and confused fresher, I wasn't sure of the development or the DSA but joining the development team, The leads really made me figure that out.

Community Engagement of the club and its dedication to giving back to the community has been exceptional. Volunteering in the hackathon was definitely an exposure to the competing tech world and also a reality check. 
Also made me work harder to see myself as one of the participants.

Speaking of the events, I was hosting one and it was so amazing to watch and learn how quickly all the members were coming up with the solution of any difficulties that were coming on the way. 

Now finally speaking bout the TECH part,
Right now my tech stack has definitely evolved.
It is HTML,JS,CSS (bootstrap and tailwind),React(learning phase), node.js, three.js.
The leads, the co-leads, and my fellow members, All of them are so helpful and non-judging. 
They are for real like one of the “elite seniors” everyone wants, asking silly doubts(without being judged), getting scolded, and having endless random conversations that made this club into a family.
They are the ones because of which I knew what I had to do next in my web developer journey and what the new update is, what trends are, and everything.

As I look forward to the upcoming academic year, I have no doubt that Codechef will continue to shine and accomplish even greater feats.

Excited to see what awaits now!
